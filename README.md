# policies
I'm collecting the privacy policies and terms of service for all of the things I do online because I suspect they're voluminous and maybe we can learn something from them.

I use Trevor Tim's [Make.text bookmarklet](http://trevorjim.com/projects/make.text/) to turn the policies into raw Markdown.
